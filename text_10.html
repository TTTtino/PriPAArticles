      <h1>95% of new workers are foreigners</h1>
      <p>Unemployment at 11-year low despite Brexit fears</p>
      <p>
        Employment levels in Britain are at an all-time high, fuelled by the
        biggest surge of foreign-born workers since the expansion of the
        European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of people in work increased by 454,000 between July and
        September last year and the same period this year. Workers born overseas
        made up nearly 95 per cent of the increase â€” just over 430,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rise in foreign-born workers accounting for jobs growth is the
        largest since 2004 when eight eastern European states joined the EU,
        setting off one of the biggest waves of immigration in British history.
        In other years since then, however, a higher proportion of jobs growth
        went to workers born overseas.
