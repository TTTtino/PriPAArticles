        Imperial College London’s REACT-LC study found catching Covid-19 in the
        colder winter months may be a factor in whether some people find their
        symptoms persisting

        More people could avoid debilitating Long Covid if they catch the virus
        in the warmer months of the year, new research suggests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latest findings from the most detailed study yet into the little
        understood syndrome found that rates dropped as the British weather
        improved.

        Researchers believe catching the virus in the colder winter months may
        be a factor in whether some symptoms persist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initial polling conducted between September 2020 and February 2021 on
        508,000 Brits found that of those who reported having had Covid, 37% had
        at least one lasting symptom 12 weeks later.

      <p>
        New data on 100,000 more Brits who took part in Imperial College
        London’s REACT-LC study shows those questioned in May 2021 saw
        prevalence drop to 22%.
      </p>

        One theory is that getting outdoor social contact and exercise in the
        brighter weather improves the chances of recovering from lasting
        illness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Author Prof Helen Ward said: “Fatigue and tiredness was the most
        commonly reported symptoms. They may have symptoms that are affected by
        the seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Even if the [Long Covid] estimates are at the lower end of the
        spectrum, we conclude that a lot of people have long persisting
        symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is a major, major challenge [for the NHS ]. It’s the next big
        global health challenge.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The findings, soon to be published in the journal Nature Communications,
        show women are 38% more likely to suffer with Long Covid despite being
        less likely than men to suffer with severe complications during the
        initial infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed analysis found that symptoms that lasted for at least 12 weeks
        tended to group together.

        Many patients suffer lingering respiratory symptoms such as tight chest
        and shortness of breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second group of Long Covid sufferers tended to have tiredness, muscle
        and joint aches as well as difficulty sleeping
      </p>
      <p>
        Initial polling had come at the height of the pandemic when many people
        were going through lockdowns and staying home more.
