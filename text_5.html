        The civil servants’ intervention has infuriated feminists, who branded
        it the latest example of “making women unmentionable”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Foreign Office oppose the use of the phrase as it may 'exclude
        transgender people who have given birth' and recommended using 'pregnant
        people' instead.

        THE government has been ridiculed for trying to ban the term “pregnant
        women” — as it could offend transgender parents.

        Feminists and MPs blasted the “idiotic” proposal, which emerged from a
        draft UN human rights paper.

      <p>
        The Foreign Office warned the term “pregnant women” could “exclude
        transgender people who have given birth”
      </p>
      <p>
        Officials insisted it could “exclude transgender people who have given
        birth”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, it should be replaced with the term “pregnant people”, they
        suggested.
