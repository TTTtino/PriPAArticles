        Covid pandemic is officially over and is no longer a global health
        emergency, WHO says
      </h1>
      <p>
        THE Covid pandemic is officially over, the World Health Organisation has
        declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outbreak, designated a crisis in January 2020, is no longer a global
        public health emergency, it said.
      </p>
      <p>
        In just three years, the virus has killed an estimated 20million but the
        daily toll has fallen to a few hundred from a peak of 14,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UK, the first nation to roll out a jab and among the first to switch
        to living with Covid, has had 223,396 deaths, figures show.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHO general secretary Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “With great
        hope I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He hailed health workers, scientists and the public for their efforts
        and sacrifices but said the “moment for celebration” should not
        overshadow the deep scars left by the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said people died unnecessarily because governments failed to work
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        He added: “We must promise ourselves and our children and grandchildren
        we’ll never make those mistakes again.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The worst thing any country could do now is to use this news as a
        reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or
        to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry
        about.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Health Secretary Steve Barclay said: “We welcome the news from the WHO.
