        My first column in this section was written just over three years ago
        when a thing called “coronavirus” was dominating message boards and
        epidemiologists, once a rather obscure group, were appearing on
        television to warn of a possible calamity. It was a curious time, one of
        uncertainty and foreboding, when we looked at one other, and our
        leaders, wondering: what does it all portend?

        Last week the World Health Organisation — not an institution that
        covered itself in glory — declared the Covid emergency over. This may
        seem strange to many in the West, since the virus has been somewhat
        under the radar since the vaccine programme conferred widespread
        immunity.
