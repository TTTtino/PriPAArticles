        A disturbing video showing visuals of a faith healer electrocuting
        children and adults, who are seen writhing in pain, is circulating with
        false claims that Hindu minorities are forcibly being converted to Islam
        through electrocution in Pakistan's Peshawar. BOOM found that the viral
        video from 2020 shows an act of exorcism performed by a Muslim faith
        healer; the fake faith healer, named Muhammad Ullah was later arrested
        by the Peshawar Police.

        The video is circulating on Twitter with a caption in Hindi: “A case of
        forcible conversion of Hindu minorities, including children to Islam by
        electrocution and extreme torture in Peshawar Pakistan has come to
        light. What a pathetic condition of Hindus with whom there is no
        international media or human rights organization.”
